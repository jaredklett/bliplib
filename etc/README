BlipLib - a Java library for interacting with Blip.tv
=====================================================

* Using the library

    Take a look at the BlipLibSample.java file. It should illustrate,
generally, how to use the classes in this library in tandem to perform an
upload with feedback that can be shown to the user.

* Dependencies

    This library relies on the Apache Jakarta HTTPClient package, which an be
found here:

http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/

    This package, in turn, relies on Apache Jakarta codec and logging packages.
All the necessary dependencies are included as .jar files in the lib directory.
Be sure to add these to your classpath.

    The version of the HTTPClient package that is included is 3.0.1. Feel free
to use a later version if you wish, but understand that the BlipLib package may
not have been tested with that version of the package.
